If you are like most people, you probably enjoy betting on sports. And if you are like most people, you would also like to be better at it. Well, you have come to the right place. In this article, we will discuss some tips on how to become a successful sports bettor.

First and foremost, it is important to understand that gambling is a game of chance. This means that there is no surefire way to win every time you bet. However, there are ways to increase your chances of winning and minimize your losses.

One of the most important things to do when betting on sports is to research the teams and players involved. This includes looking at past results, as well as current form and injuries. Doing your homework will give you a better idea of which teams and players are likely to win or lose.

Another key factor in betting on sports is to use sound money management techniques. This means betting what you can afford to lose and not chasing your losses. It also means ensuring that your bets are properly calibrated to your odds of winning. For example, if you think there is a 50% chance of a team winning, then it is wise to bet no more than half of what you would normally wager on that team.

Finally, it is important to stay disciplined when betting on sports. This includes not getting emotional about wins or losses, and sticking to your pre-determined betting strategy.

#  The Science of Sports Betting: A Washington Commander Handicapper reveals all

The following is a guest post by Mike, a Washington state based sports handicapper who goes by the online name of "Commander".

As someone who has followed and wagered on sports for over 25 years, I've learned a thing or two about how to beat the odds. And while there is no guaranteed strategy to win every bet, I am going to share with you what I believe to be the most important aspects of sports betting so that you can at least give yourself the best chance possible.

To begin with, it's important to understand that there are three ways to make money when betting on sports: by winning bets outright, by overcoming the odds and cashing in on parlays and accumulators, or by correctly predicting outcome margins (the point spread).

Outright wins are pretty self-explanatory, but overcoming the odds can be a bit more complicated. When two teams matchup against each other, the oddsmakers will set a "line" or point spread which gives one team what is essentially an artificial handicap. This margin is designed to create as close to an even matchup as possible, with the assumption being that most people will wager on the favored team. However, if you believe that the underdog stands a legitimate chance of winning or covering the spread, you can make money by betting on them.

The final way to make money off of sports betting is by correctly predicting outcome margins. As I mentioned earlier, the oddsmakers will set a point spread for each game in order to create an equal playing field. However, this line isn't always accurate, and it's possible to make money by betting on one side when the line is actually skewed in another direction.

Now that you have a basic understanding of how sports betting works, let's take a look at some of the key strategies that you can use in order to increase your chances of winning.

1) Start small and only bet what you can afford to lose – One of the biggest mistakes that people make when they start betting on sports is placing too much money on each bet. This can quickly lead to disaster if things don't go your way and can result in losing way more than you're comfortable with. It's important to start small and gradually increase your wagers as you gain more experience and become more comfortable with the process. That way, if you do happen to lose a few bets in succession, you won't end up busting your bankroll.

2) Research matchups thoroughly – Just like any other form of gambling or investment, doing your homework is critical when it comes to betting on sports. This means taking the time to research both teams involved in each matchup as well as looking at past results, home/road splits, injuries etc. By having a good understanding of all relevant factors involved in each game, you'll be better equipped make informed decisions about which bets to place your money on.

3) Use multiple sources for information – Don't just rely on one source for information when making your bets; use multiple sources such as ESPN, Yahoo! Sports etc). Different sources often have different takes on individual matchups which can help give you a well-rounded perspective and increase your chances of making a wise decision.
