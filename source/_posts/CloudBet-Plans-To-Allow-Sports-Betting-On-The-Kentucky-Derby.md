#  CloudBet Plans To Allow Sports Betting On The Kentucky Derby

CloudBet, a leading bitcoin and cryptocurrency sportsbook, is gearing up to allow betting on the Kentucky Derby next month. The company has long been a proponent of bitcoin and other digital currencies as a means of betting, and this move is seen as another step in legitimizing bitcoin and its use in the online gambling space.

CloudBet’s Director of Marketing, Naysan Nava, had this to say about the upcoming Kentucky Derby:

“We are excited about our plans to offer betting on the Kentucky Derby. We see this as another vindication of bitcoin and its role in the global gambling market. Digital currencies have already taken over traditional forms of payment for online gambling, and we believe that this trend will only continue as people become more comfortable with using them.”

CloudBet joins a growing number of sportsbooks that are now accepting bets on the Kentucky Derby. Leading US-based sportsbook Bovada has already announced that it will be taking bets on the race, and several other smaller sportsbooks are likely to follow suit in the coming weeks. This growing interest in the Kentucky Derby reflects the overall growth of horse racing as a global sport.

The Kentucky Derby is one of the most prestigious horse races in the world, and is watched by millions of people around the globe each year. The race is run at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, and typically features some of the best horses in North America. The 2017 edition of the race will be run on May 6th, with prize money totaling $2 million.

#  Cloudbet Continues Expansion Into US Gambling Markets

Cloudbet, the bitcoin-based online gambling operator, announced on Wednesday that it has launched its services in the United States. The company said that its site is now available to players in Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware.

Cloudbet said that it has obtained licenses in all three states, which gives it the right to offer a range of online gambling products, including sports betting, casino games, and poker.

The news comes as something of a surprise, as Cloudbet had previously indicated that it was not interested in the US market. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine in March, Cloudbet CEO Marko Vukojevic said that the company was focusing its efforts on developing markets in Asia and Eastern Europe.

However, Cloudbet evidently changed tack late last year when the US Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on sports betting. In addition to Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware, several other states are now moving to legalize sports betting, presenting what analysts believe is a $150 billion opportunity.

“We have been monitoring developments in the US for some time and believe that now is the right time to enter this rapidly growing market,” Vukojevic said in a statement on Wednesday.

Cloudbet is not the only online gambling company targeting the US market. Earlier this week, Malta-based BetDNA announced that it had secured a license from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement and would be launching its services in the state later this year. Other companies such as 888 Holdings and William Hill are also preparing to enter the market.

The Kentucky Derby is the most prestigious horse race in the United States. Held annually at Churchill Downs Racetrack in Louisville, Kentucky, it features 3-year-old thoroughbred horses competing over a distance of 1 1/4 miles (2 kilometers). The race is often called "the most exciting two minutes in sports" due to the fast pace of the horses.

This year's Kentucky Derby has a very competitive field, with 14 horses entered. My top pick is Justify, who won his last race by 7 lengths and is currently the favorite to win at odds of 2-1. Other contenders include Magnum Moon (6-1), Bolt d'Oro (8-1), and Vino Rosso (12-1).
