#  Bellagio Casino Is Definitely Huge!

The Bellagio casino resort is huge! Upon arrival, we were really impressed by the sheer size of the buildings and grounds. The lobby is ornate and very welcoming. Check-in was a breeze and we were soon on our way to explore the massive property.

There are so many things to do at the Bellagio, it is hard to know where to start. We walked around the lake, visited the botanical gardens, saw the Cirque du Soleil show, played in the casino and lounged by the pool. Everywhere we went there was something new to see or do.

The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. The bathrooms are luxurious with marble floors and features. We had a great view of the Strip from our room and enjoyed watching all of the action from our balcony.

The food at the Bellagio is amazing! There are tons of restaurants to choose from, with something for everyone’s taste. We ate at some of our favourites (Tableau, Jasmine) as well as some new places that we discovered (Primrose). All were excellent! Our only regret was that we didn’t have time to try them all!

We had an amazing time at the Bellagio and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a truly incredible Las Vegas experience!
