#  What will they do?

The fate of the world has been entrusted in the hands of a few individuals. They are the ones who will make the decisions that will determine the future of humankind. But what will they do? What kind of decisions will they make?

There is no telling exactly what these people will do with their power. But there are some things that we can be sure of. For example, they will likely have to make some very tough choices. They may have to decide whether to use military force or diplomacy to resolve a conflict. Or they may have to decide how to best allocate resources in order to help improve the lives of people around the world.

Whatever decisions these people make, they will undoubtedly have a huge impact on the future of our planet. So it is crucial that we put our trust in them and hope for the best.

#  Why were they made?

The pyramids were built as tombs for pharaohs and their consorts. The pharaohs were buried in pyramids of many different shapes and sizes from before the beginning of the Old Kingdom to the end of the Middle Kingdom.

The ancient Egyptians believed that when a person died their soul would need somewhere to live, so the tombs were filled with everything the mummy might need in the afterlife, including food, furniture, clothes, and jewelry.

# How were they made?

The pyramids were constructed over a period of around 20 years using millions of blocks of stone. Most of the stones used were limestone, which was quarried from hills near the Nile River.

The stones were cut into blocks that weighed between 2 and 15 tons each. They were then transported to the pyramid site on wooden sledges that slid over logs placed on top of rollers made from tree trunks.

The blocks were then put into place using ropes, wooden levers, and human labor. The largest pyramid, built by Khufu (or Cheops), is about 450 feet high and covers an area of 13 acres.

#  How will they help eco-tourism?

Green infrastructure is becoming an increasingly important topic for eco-tourism, as planners and tourism professionals look for ways to make the industry more sustainable. Green infrastructure can help manage storm water, improve air quality, and enhance recreation opportunities.

The built environment can have a significant impact on the environment, and this is especially true in areas that are popular with tourists. Tourism can put a lot of strain on natural resources, so it is important for destinations to take steps to mitigate the negative impacts of tourism. Green infrastructure can play a key role in helping destinations become more sustainable.

There are many different types of green infrastructure, but they all share a common goal: to improve the environment while also creating economic and social benefits. For example, green roofs can help reduce energy costs by cooling buildings during the summer months. They also provide valuable habitat for wildlife, which can attract tourists.

Green infrastructure can also help manage storm water runoff. Storm water runoff can pollute waterways and damage ecosystems. Green infrastructure can help reduce the amount of pollutants that reach waterways by capturing and treating storm water runoff. This helps keep our waterways clean and supports healthy ecosystems.

Air quality is another important issue for eco-tourism. Poor air quality can negatively impact human health and ecosystems. Green infrastructure can help improve air quality by reducing emissions from vehicles and factories, as well as trapping pollutants near the ground level. This helps keep harmful pollutants out of the atmosphere and reduces their impact on human health and the environment.

Finally, green infrastructure can also create social and economic benefits for communities. It can create jobs in the construction and maintenance industries, increase local tax revenue, and attract new businesses to an area. In addition, green infrastructure can improve recreational opportunities in an area, which can lead to increased tourism revenue.

Green infrastructure is a promising solution for eco-tourism that offers many benefits for both the environment and the economy. It is an important tool for destinations looking to become more sustainable, and it has the potential to create social and economic benefits for communities as well.

#  Who made them?

Humans have always been fascinated by the possibility of creating artificial life. For centuries, we have dreamed of creating mechanical beings that could act and think like us. The idea of a robot – a machine that can be programmed to do our bidding – has captured our imaginations for generations.

But who made them? Robotics has come a long way in the past few decades, but we are still a long way from creating anything close to resembling human intelligence. So who, or what, is behind the current wave of advanced robotics?

Some experts believe that artificial intelligence is being created by aliens. They point to the sudden advancement in robotics technology and argue that it must be coming from somewhere else. But this theory is highly unlikely. The universe is vast, and it’s highly improbable that any other intelligent life exists out there.

More likely, artificial intelligence is being created by humans themselves. With rapid advancements in computer technology and data storage, it’s becoming increasingly easier for humans to create sophisticated machines. In fact, many experts believe that true artificial intelligence will be achieved within the next few decades.

So who made them? We did. Humans are behind the current wave of advanced robotics, and we are only going to become more proficient in this field in the years to come.
