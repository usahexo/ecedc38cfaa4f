#  Sharks Most Likely to Gamble at Santas Wonderland

It’s the most wonderful time of the year and sharks are getting into the festive spirit, too! In fact, some of our favorite ocean predators can be found at Santas Wonderland, a holiday-themed attraction in San Diego. So what kinds of sharks can you expect to see?

The smallest shark at Santas Wonderland is the smooth dogfish. This little guy grows to about 3 feet long and is typically harmless to humans. He’s known for being shy and tends to avoid contact with people.

Next up is the horn shark. These graceful creatures can be found all along the Pacific coast and grow up to 4 feet long. They have small dorsal fins and a unique set of barbels that protrude from their upper lips. Horn sharks are typically docile creatures but can become aggressive when threatened.

At the other end of the size spectrum is the great white shark. Growing up to 20 feet long, this apex predator is one of the largest fish in the ocean. Despite their size, great whites are mostly harmless to humans and are actually quite timid. However, they should never be underestimated – they’re still capable of inflicting serious injuries.

Finally, there’s the angel shark. These odd-looking creatures can be found throughout most of the world’s temperate waters and can grow up to 5 feet long. Angel sharks are ambush predators and use their flat body shape and camouflage coloration to hide from prey. They can also breathe through their skin, allowing them to stay underwater for hours at a time.

#  How to Spot a Shark Gambling at Santas Wonderland

As the days until Christmas dwindle, more and more people hit up Santas Wonderland in search of holiday thrills. While the amusement park offers a wealth of activities for families, it can be a playground for sharks looking to gamble.

1. Look for someone who is excessively animated or betting large sums of money. Sharks often get caught up in the excitement of gambling and can be easy to spot.

2. Watch for people who are attempting to conceal their bets. Sharks will often try to hide their bets when they are losing in order to avoid detection.

3. Be aware of anyone who seems overly eager to gamble. Sharks often have a need to win and can be quite pushy when it comes to betting.

4. Avoid any gambler who is hostile or aggressive. Sharks can be quick to anger and may become verbally abusive if they lose their bet.

5. If you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, leave the area immediately. It is always better to be safe than sorry, especially when dealing with sharks!
