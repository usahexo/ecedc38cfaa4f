#  Winning waitress tips at Maple Room Casino

The Maple Room Casino is a great place to gamble, eat, and drink. The casino offers a variety of table games, slots, and restaurants. My favorite spot is the sushi restaurant. The waitresses are always friendly and attentive. They provide great service and winning tips. Here are four tips to get the best service and biggest tips from your waitress at the Maple Room Casino:

1) tip your waitress well

The best way to get great service from your waitress is to tip her well. A good rule of thumb is to tip at least 20 percent. This will ensure that your waitress takes care of you and provides good service. If you have a large party, be sure to tip your waitress accordingly.

2) order drinks from your waitress

Whenever you order a drink at the casino, be sure to order it from your waitress. This will ensure that she takes care of you and brings you fresh drinks promptly. If you need another drink, don’t hesitate to ask your waitress for one.

3) ask for help when needed

If you need help with anything—whether it’s placing a bet or finding a seat—don’t hesitate to ask your waitress for assistance. She will be happy to help you out and make sure that you have a great time at the casino.

4) be polite and friendly

Finally, be polite and friendly towards your waitress. This will ensure that she takes care of you and provides excellent service. Remember, the better relationship you have with your waitress, the more likely she is to give you winning tips!

#  $2,500 in tips for one shift at the Maple Room Casino

Working at a casino can be a fun and exciting way to make some extra money. But it can also be lucrative. Just ask the server at the Maple Room Casino who recently walked away with $2,500 in tips after one shift.

The server, who asked to remain anonymous, says that the tips came from a group of regular customers who visit the casino often. “They were in a great mood and just wanted to give me something extra for my hard work,” she said.

In addition to the $2,500 in tips, the server also received a $100 bonus from her employer.

While not all shifts at the casino will result in such a windfall, it goes to show that servers can make some serious cash by providing great service to their guests. So what are you waiting for? Start working at your local casino today!
