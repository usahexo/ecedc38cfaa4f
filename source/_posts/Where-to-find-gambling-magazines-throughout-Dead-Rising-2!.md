#  Blackjack 37 - Ruby Tips and Tricks!

This article is a compilation of tips, tricks and techniques related to the Ruby programming language!

## 1. Use of __method__ and __attr__ on objects Sometimes you need to get information about an object but don't want to use regular method calls. For this, you can use the __method__ and __attr__ methods. The __method__ method gives you the name of the method called, while the __attr__ method gives you the attribute value at that point in time.

For example:

Person = Struct .new( :name ) person = Person .new( " bob " ) puts person.name # => "bob" puts person.__method__ # => "name" puts person.__attr__ # => "bob"

You can also use these methods when working with classes:

class Person attr_reader :name def initialize (name) @name = name end end person = Person .new("bob") puts person.name # => "bob" puts person.__method__ # => "initialize" puts person.__attr__ # => "name"
