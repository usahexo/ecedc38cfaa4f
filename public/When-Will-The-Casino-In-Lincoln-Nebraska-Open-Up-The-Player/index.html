Especially, when that casino is the first of its kind in the state. This is what players in Lincoln, Nebraska are waiting for. As of now, there is no confirmation as to when this casino will finally open up to the public. However, we can take a look at some of the factors that are delaying it.</p>
<p>The Holdup</p>
<p>There are actually several reasons as to why the casino has yet to open its doors. The primary issue seems to be finding a qualified person to run the place. Apparently, many people have applied for the position but none of them have been deemed satisfactory. This has caused a bit of a delay for the casino officials.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are still some construction issues that need to be addressed. It was recently announced that there was going to be a change in management and this has caused some delays as well. With everything that needs to be done, it is no surprise that the opening has been pushed back multiple times.</p>
<p>What Does The Future Hold?</p>
<p>At this point, it is hard to say when the casino will actually open up. However, we can make some guesses based on what we know so far. It is possible that they may find someone to run the place within the next month or two but construction may take longer than that. In all honesty, it could be anywhere from four to six months before we see anything happen. Unfortunately, this means that players will have to wait quite some time before they can start gambling at this establishment.</p>
