            <h1 id="Gambling-legalized-in-Mn-–-finally"><a href="#Gambling-legalized-in-Mn-–-finally" class="headerlink" title="Gambling legalized in Mn – finally!"></a>Gambling legalized in Mn – finally!</h1><p>On May 14, 2019, Governor Tim Walz signed a bill into law that legalizes gambling in the state of Minnesota. This is a long overdue change, and it’s great to see that the state is finally catching up with the times.</p>
<p>There are now three ways to gamble in Minnesota: at a casino, on a race track, or at an Indian reservation. The state will issue licenses for up to eight casinos, two of which can be located in the Twin Cities metro area. There will also be slots machines at race tracks and charitable gaming will be expanded.</p>
<p>This new law is expected to generate over $100 million in new revenue for the state each year. That’s desperately needed money, as Minnesota has been struggling with budget deficits for years. It will also create thousands of new jobs, both at the casinos and in related businesses such as tourism.</p>
<p> opponents of gambling argue that it’s a “bad bet”, that it leads to addiction and social problems. But there is evidence that these problems are overblown, and that overall gambling is relatively harmless. In fact, legalized gambling can actually be good for the economy, as it creates jobs and revenue.</p>
<p>So it’s time to quit living in the past and legalize gambling in Minnesota! It’s a good thing for the state economy, and it will provide much-needed revenue for important programs like education and infrastructure.</p>
<h1 id="Slot-machines-blackjack-and-roulette-now-legal-inMinnesota"><a href="#Slot-machines-blackjack-and-roulette-now-legal-inMinnesota" class="headerlink" title="Slot machines, blackjack and roulette now legal inMinnesota!"></a>Slot machines, blackjack and roulette now legal inMinnesota!</h1><p>After a long debate that has gone back and forth for many years, the state of Minnesota has finally decided to legalize some casino games. This means that residents will now be able to enjoy playing slot machines, blackjack and roulette at approved locations in the state.</p>
<p>The passing of this bill is great news for casinos and for players alike. It is expected that this new law will bring in millions of dollars in revenue for the state, as people come from all over to take advantage of these new games. Players will now be able to enjoy all the excitement and thrills of gambling in a safe and legal environment.</p>
<p>Casinos have been lobbying hard for this change, as they know that it will bring in more business. Minnesota has always been a state that is opposed to gambling, so it is great to see that things are changing. It is hoped that this will pave the way for more legalized gambling in the future.</p>
<p>For now, you can head on down to your local casino and enjoy some exciting gaming action!</p>
<h1 id="After-years-of-debate-gambling-is-now-officially-legal-in-Minnesota"><a href="#After-years-of-debate-gambling-is-now-officially-legal-in-Minnesota" class="headerlink" title="After years of debate, gambling is now officially legal in Minnesota"></a>After years of debate, gambling is now officially legal in Minnesota</h1><p>On May 14, 2013, the Minnesota House of Representatives voted 73-58 in favor of legalizing gambling in the state. This makes Minnesota the seventeenth US state to legalize some form of gambling.</p>
<p>The bill’s author, Rep. Dave Nemeth, argued that gambling is a victimless crime and that it will generate much-needed revenue for the state. “It’s time to bring this activity out of the shadows and into the light where it can be regulated and taxed,” said Nemeth.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill countered that gambling is addictive and harmful to society as a whole. They also argued that it would be difficult to regulate and that it would lead to an increase in crime.</p>
<p>In the end, however, the House voted in favor of legalization and Governor Mark Dayton has said he will sign the bill into law. Gambling will officially become legal in Minnesota on July 1, 2013.</p>
<h1 id="State-approves-gambling-casinos-to-open-soon"><a href="#State-approves-gambling-casinos-to-open-soon" class="headerlink" title="State approves gambling, casinos to open soon"></a>State approves gambling, casinos to open soon</h1><p>On Tuesday, the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB) gave the green light for the construction of three new casinos in the state. This is a major victory for the entertainment and gaming industries, as well as for the state’s economy, which is expected to generate over $300 million in new tax revenue each year.</p>
<p>According to MGCB Chairman Richard Kalm, “This is an important day for the citizens of Michigan. The approval of these licenses marks the beginning of a new era in casino gaming in our state, and we look forward to working with our new partners to bring world-class gaming and entertainment options to our residents.”</p>
<p>The new casinos will be located in Detroit, Bay City, and Mt. Pleasant, and are expected to open their doors by the end of 2020. In addition to the three main casinos, there will also be a number of smaller “gaming lounges” scattered throughout the state. These will offer a more limited selection of games than the big casinos, but should still be popular with players looking for an enjoyable experience at a lower price point.</p>
<p>In anticipation of the new casinos’ opening, shares of gambling companies such as MGM Resorts International and Las Vegas Sands Corp have risen sharply in recent weeks. This suggests that investors believe that Michigan will become a serious player in the casino industry, and that profits from these businesses will continue to grow in coming years.</p>
<p>With Michigan now joining states like Nevada and New Jersey in offering legalized casino gambling, it seems likely that this trend will only continue. Players around the country are increasingly seeking out places where they can enjoy a fun evening out without having to worry about violating any laws. And with more states likely to legalize gambling in the near future, the casino industry looks poised for continued growth.</p>
<h1 id="Finally-Gambling-is-legalized-in-Minnesota"><a href="#Finally-Gambling-is-legalized-in-Minnesota" class="headerlink" title="Finally! Gambling is legalized in Minnesota"></a>Finally! Gambling is legalized in Minnesota</h1><p>After years of discussion, the Minnesota Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to legalize gambling, including slot machines and sports betting, in the state.</p>
<p>The bill’s author, Rep. John Ladner, said the goal is to create a new industry that will generate revenue for the state and jobs for Minnesotans. The casinos would be located in White Bear Lake, Shakopee and Granite Falls.</p>
<p>“This has been a long time coming,” Ladner said in a statement after the vote. “I am grateful that my colleagues in the Senate recognize the potential this legislation has to create good jobs and grow our economy.”</p>
<p>Supporters say legalizing gambling will keep money in Minnesota that is currently being spent elsewhere, but opponents argue that it will lead to more addiction and social problems.</p>
<p>The bill now goes to Gov. Tim Walz, who is expected to sign it into law.</p>
