            <h1 id="What-is-OrientalGame"><a href="#What-is-OrientalGame" class="headerlink" title="What is OrientalGame?"></a>What is OrientalGame?</h1><p>OrientalGame is a startup which offers a gaming platform that brings together the best of Eastern and Western board games.</p>
<p>The brainchild of three friends – one Japanese, one Swiss and one American – the company was founded with the aim of making it easier for people from around the world to share their love of board games.</p>
<p>At its heart, OrientalGame is a social platform where people can discover new games, chat with other gamers and organise tournaments. But it’s also so much more than that.</p>
<p>OrientalGame has built an extensive database of board games which includes information on how to play them, reviews by gamers and videos of actual gameplay. This makes it the perfect resource for both beginners and seasoned veterans alike.</p>
<p>In addition to its online platform, OrientalGame also has a physical store in Zurich, Switzerland which stocks over 1,000 different board games from all over the world. It’s also home to Europe’s only dedicated Board Game Bar, where gamers can come to play their favourite games or learn about new ones.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-payment-options-for-OrientalGame"><a href="#What-are-the-payment-options-for-OrientalGame" class="headerlink" title="What are the payment options for OrientalGame?"></a>What are the payment options for OrientalGame?</h1><p>There are various payment options available for OrientalGame users. The most popular methods are PayPal and credit card payments. However, there are also other options, such as bank transfers and payments through Western Union. In addition, there are also a few prepaid card options that can be used.</p>
<p>The benefits of using PayPal include the ability to cancel transactions and the safety of using an established company. PayPal is also available in many countries, which makes it a convenient option for many people. Credit card payments are also popular, as they are generally accepted by most online merchants. In addition, many credit cards offer fraud protection in case of any problems with a purchase.</p>
<p>Bank transfers can be a good option for those who do not want to use credit cards or PayPal. It is also a convenient method for those who have a bank account in the same country as OrientalGame. Bank transfers can take a few days to process, so it is important to plan ahead if this is the payment method chosen. Western Union payments can be processed quickly, making them a good choice for last minute purchases. However, Western Union charges a fee for its services, so this method can be more expensive than others.</p>
<p>Prepaid cards are another option available for OrientalGame users. These cards can be purchased at retail stores or online and can be used like regular credit cards. One downside of prepaid cards is that they often have high fees associated with them. However, they are a good option for those who do not want to use their regular credit card or do not have one.</p>
