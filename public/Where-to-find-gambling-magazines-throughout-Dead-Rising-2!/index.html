Use of <strong>method</strong> and <strong>attr</strong> on objects Sometimes you need to get information about an object but don’t want to use regular method calls. For this, you can use the <strong>method</strong> and <strong>attr</strong> methods. The <strong>method</strong> method gives you the name of the method called, while the <strong>attr</strong> method gives you the attribute value at that point in time.</h2><p>For example:</p>
<p>Person = Struct .new( :name ) person = Person .new( “ bob “ ) puts person.name # =&gt; “bob” puts person.<strong>method</strong> # =&gt; “name” puts person.<strong>attr</strong> # =&gt; “bob”</p>
<p>You can also use these methods when working with classes:</p>
<p>class Person attr_reader :name def initialize (name) @name = name end end person = Person .new(“bob”) puts person.name # =&gt; “bob” puts person.<strong>method</strong> # =&gt; “initialize” puts person.<strong>attr</strong> # =&gt; “name”</p>

Some of these magazines offer great tips and tricks, while others simply contain interesting insights into the game’s characters and story. In this article, we’ll take a look at where all of the gambling magazines can be found.</p>
<p>Note: This guide assumes that you are playing on the “Normal” difficulty setting.</p>
<p>The first gambling magazine can be found in the Slot Ranch Casino, which is located in the South Plaza area of Fortune City. In the main casino area, make your way to the back-left corner of the room and you’ll find the magazine on a small table.</p>
<p>The next gambling magazine is also located in the Slot Ranch Casino, but can only be found after activating the side quest called “Strip Poker”. Once you have activated this quest, head to the VIP Lounge area of the casino and make your way to the back-left corner of the room. The magazine will be sitting on a small table.</p>
<p>The third and final gambling magazine can be found in Royal Flush Plaza, which is located in the North Plaza area of Fortune City. In this area, make your way to Jill’s Sandwiches (near where you fought off Psychos during Case 7-2) and enter through the door on the right-hand side of the shop. The magazine will be sitting on a small table just inside of this room.</p>
